I personally used one of these helplines after losing funding as a graduate student during the '08 recession when I was in a really bad way. There is no shame in calling them. At. All.\\n\\nWhy is this necessary to post and share and sticky? As /u/ThrowawayHistory20 said in a previous thread:\\n>Many of us seeking admission to top tier grad schools, and just grad schools in general, grew up our whole lives hearing ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre so smart!‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so good at X field!‚Äù from parents, teachers, friends, etc. That then causes many of us, myself included, to internalize this belief that being smart or good at our field or just knowing a lot of things is what makes us valuable. It can help drive us to be good at our field (though in a toxic way because it‚Äôs driven by a fear that if we fall behind, we lose the thing that make us valuable), but it also makes rejection very rough.\\n\\n>We know logically that when we get rejected from a top school in a competitive field that it means ‚Äúyou were a well qualified applicant, but there were too many well qualified applicants for us to take everyone,‚Äù but it can feel more like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not good enough at the one thing you‚Äôre good at and the one thing that gives you value as a human being.‚Äù\\n\\nAgain, please share any additional resources and/or helplines here.\\n\\nArchived Helpline Info:\\n\\nIn the US, you can call 988 for crisis support, or 1-877-GRAD-HLP for support specific to graduate students/grad school issues.\\n\\nText 'HELP' to 741741 in the United States, or 686868 in Canada.\\n\\nAustralian folks can call 13 11 14.\\n\\nIn the UK, text 85258.\\n\\nIn Brazil, The CVV number is 188.\\n\\nIn India, call 022 2754 6669.  \n",
              "1    Hello everyone,\\n\\nThe aim of this post is to [follow up on our previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1456kiz/gradadmissions_and_the_reddit_blackout_protest/).\\n\\nAs an update, while Reddit has made some initial moves that have been promising, especially on the subject of mod tools. Many of the core concerns raised by the protests, especially in regards to having accessibility options for the visually impaired, haven't really been dealt with. While Reddit has made promises, the downside is that Reddit has a history of making promises and never following up on them.\\n\\nMeanwhile as some of you might have noticed, if you follow these things, Reddit's top leadership has gone on something of a blitz, threatening moderators, attacking them as a whole, removing them from communities they've worked at keeping functional. [Places like AskHistorians have detailed some of this, and the troubling questions in regards to how Reddit reacts to moderators on whose free labor its successful operations are contingent on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14dd0ae/askhistorians_will_remain_in_limited_operation/) You can always find more detailed information, and discussion, on places such as r/SubredditDrama.\\n\\nUnlike most subreddits, and as mentioned in the follow-up, we don't believe blacking out gradadmissions would be helpful, even if the moderator team were unanimous about it. The aim of this subreddit is to be a resource for those in need, not just a place for casual discussion. There would be many who would be harmed by an inability to have their questions answered.\\n\\nSo as the ungrateful, mean and [autocratic landed gentry](https://gizmodo.com/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-landed-gentry-1850546737) that Reddit seems to regards us mods, we'd like to place these two options on how to move forward, let the community decide on what might be best.\\n\\nThe first option will be a **restriction three days every week** to continue protesting Reddit's actions, and frankly recent policies and statements about its communities and its moderators. Inspired by the likes or r/pics, during this time only posts that discuss what John Oliver might have to say about Graduate Admissions will be allowed. EDIT: I should clarify here, that during the three days of restriction, no ***new*** **posts** will be allowed. The subreddit will not be private. It will be searchable, and it will be possible to comment on existing posts. What we will restrict is the ability to make new posts, as subreddits like r/history are doing. But in a more limited capacity so as to strike a balance.\\n\\nThe second option is to have no restrictions whatsoever going forward.

I'm worried about not even receiving interview invites and just getting ghosted. Worried that I won't even be given a chance.\\n\\nMy grades are trash but I explained the very circumstantial reasons why on my application and outlined why those issues will not arise again. My essays, letters of recommendation, and research experience reflect how hard I have tried and how much work I've put into this. I've always tried. But there will always be another person who has also tried and has never had the issues I've dealt with so their grades are excellent and there's absolutely no reason why admissions would choose me over them. Which makes sense because those applicants deserve it and I'm not entitled to being given a chance. IDK this is just a rant. I'm anxious lol.  \n",

Man where have the standards reached?? Do I need to be a rocket scientist to get into one of the top 100?!!

Assuming they took enough related classes, could a history major get a Ph.D. in art? How about chemistry? If someone with a slightly relevant degree took enough related courses, would they be just as competitive as someone with a highly relevant degree? For example, if someone with a background in Electrical Engineering took enough classes, could they be as competitive as a math major for a PhD in topology?  \\n(For context, I'm currently completing my BS in mechanical engineering with a math and computer science minor. I have been researching operations research, and I'd like to get a Ph.D. in it (particularly optimization theory) and I'm contemplating if I should double major in math or take relevant classes and stay with my MechE BS)  \n",

As /u/ThrowawayHistory20 said in a previous thread:\\n&gt;Many of us seeking admission to top tier grad schools, and just grad schools in general, grew up our whole lives hearing ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre so smart!‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so good at X field!‚Äù from parents, teachers, friends, etc. That then causes many of us, myself included, to internalize this belief that being smart or good at our field or just knowing a lot of things is what makes us valuable. It can help drive us to be good at our field (though in a toxic way because it‚Äôs driven by a fear that if we fall behind, we lose the thing that make us valuable), but it also makes rejection very rough.\\n\\n&gt;We know logically that when we get rejected from a top school in a competitive field that it means ‚Äúyou were a well qualified applicant, but there were too many well qualified applicants for us to take everyone,‚Äù but it can feel more like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not good enough at the one thing you‚Äôre good at and the one thing that gives you value as a human being.‚Äù\\n\\nAgain, please share any additional resources and/or helplines here.\\n\\nArchived Helpline Info:\\n\\nIn the US, you can call 988 for crisis support, or 1-877-GRAD-HLP for support specific to graduate students/grad school issues.\\n\\nText 'HELP' to 741741 in the United States, or 686868 in Canada.\\n\\nAustralian folks can call 13 11 14.\\n\\nIn the UK, text 85258.\\n\\nIn Brazil, The CVV number is 188.\\n\\nIn India, call 022 2754 6669.</td>\n",

Many of the core concerns raised by the protests, especially in regards to having accessibility options for the visually impaired, haven't really been dealt with. While Reddit has made promises, the downside is that Reddit has a history of making promises and never following up on them.\\n\\nMeanwhile as some of you might have noticed, if you follow these things, Reddit's top leadership has gone on something of a blitz, threatening moderators, attacking them as a whole, removing them from communities they've worked at keeping functional. [Places like AskHistorians have detailed some of this, and the troubling questions in regards to how Reddit reacts to moderators on whose free labor its successful operations are contingent on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14dd0ae/askhistorians_will_remain_in_limited_operation/) You can always find more detailed information, and discussion, on places such as r/SubredditDrama.\\n\\nUnlike most subreddits, and as mentioned in the follow-up, we don't believe blacking out gradadmissions would be helpful, even if the moderator team were unanimous about it. The aim of this subreddit is to be a resource for those in need, not just a place for casual discussion. There would be many who would be harmed by an inability to have their questions answered.\\n\\nSo as the ungrateful, mean and [autocratic landed gentry](https://gizmodo.com/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-landed-gentry-1850546737) that Reddit seems to regards us mods, we'd like to place these two options on how to move forward, let the community decide on what might be best.\\n\\nThe first option will be a **restriction three days every week** to continue protesting Reddit's actions, and frankly recent policies and statements about its communities and its moderators. Inspired by the likes or r/pics, during this time only posts that discuss what John Oliver might have to say about Graduate Admissions will be allowed. EDIT: I should clarify here, that during the three days of restriction, no ***new*** **posts** will be allowed. The subreddit will not be private. It will be searchable, and it will be possible to comment on existing posts. What we will restrict is the ability to make new posts, as subreddits like r/history are doing. But in a more limited capacity so as to strike a balance.\\n\\nThe second option is to have no restrictions whatsoever going forward. If the userbase here has no interest on the quality of life of subreddit moderation, we will respect that.\\n\\nAs a caveat, this subreddit has over two hundred thousand subscribers and at any given point seems to have &gt;500 people online. If the votes on the poll do not reach atleast 750-1000 votes, we would consider it inconclusive, and take our best judgment call on how to move forward.\\n\\nFeel free to share your thoughts and ideas below as well.\\n\\nEDIT: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds\\_meetings\\_with\\_reddit\\_and\\_the\\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/)\\n\\nAn update from r/blind and an example of the sorts of accessibility problems for mods and users that the API changes create\\n\\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/14dgpfl)</td>\n",
